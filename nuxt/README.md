This is a **Nuxt 4-based CMS Template** that is fully integrated with [Directus](https://directus.io/), offering a CMS
solution for managing and delivering content seamlessly. The template leverages modern technologies like **Nuxt 4's
file-based routing system**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn Vue components**, providing a complete and scalable starting
point for building CMS-powered web applications.

## **Draft Mode in Directus and Live Preview**

### **Draft Mode Overview**

Directus allows you to work on unpublished content using **Draft Mode**. This Nuxt 4 template is configured to support
Directus Draft Mode out of the box, enabling live previews of unpublished or draft content as you make changes.

### **Content Versioning in Directus 12**

In Directus 12, the published content version is called `published` (formerly `main`), and every versioned item
automatically gets a `draft` version. Published items are locked in the Studio — edits happen on the draft version and
are promoted to publish. This template handles both keys: preview URLs with `version=published` (or the legacy
`version=main`) load the live content, while `version=draft` (or any custom version key) fetches that version from the
API.

### **Live Preview Setup**

[Directus Live Preview](https://docs.directus.io/guides/headless-cms/live-preview/nuxt-3.html#set-up-live-preview-with-nuxt-3)

- The live preview feature works seamlessly on deployed environments.
- **For Local Development**: If using local Docker, the CSP configuration is provided in `.env.example`. See [`../../directus/README.md`](../../directus/README.md#content-security-policy-csp-and-preview-issues) for details.
- **For Directus Cloud**: Directus Cloud requires HTTPS for previews. You'll need to use HTTPS tunneling (ngrok, localtunnel, etc.) or configure CSP in your Directus Cloud settings. See the [main README troubleshooting section](../../README.md#preview-not-working---content-security-policy-csp-issues) for details.


## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

To set up this template, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (20.x or newer)
- **pnpm** (8.6.0 or newer) or **npm**
- Access to a **Directus** instance ([cloud or self-hosted](../../README.md))

## ⚠️ Directus Setup Instructions

For instructions on setting up Directus, choose one of the following:

- [Setting up Directus Cloud](https://github.com/directus-labs/starters?tab=readme-ov-file#using-directus-with-a-cloud-instance-recommended)
- [Setting up Directus Self-Hosted](https://github.com/directus-labs/starters?tab=readme-ov-file#using-directus-locally)

## 🚀 One-Click Deploy

You can instantly deploy this template using one of the following platforms:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/directus-labs/starters/tree/main/cms/nuxt&env=DIRECTUS_URL,NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,DIRECTUS_SERVER_TOKEN,NUXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_VISUAL_EDITING)

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/directus-labs/starters&branch=main&create_from_path=cms/nuxt)

### **Environment Variables**

To get started, you need to configure environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. **Copy the example environment file:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update the following variables in your `.env` file:**

   - **`DIRECTUS_URL`**: URL of your Directus instance.
   - **`DIRECTUS_SERVER_TOKEN`**: Static token from your Directus **admin account** (created during first-launch onboarding). Used server-side for fetching preview/draft content and handling form submissions. With a licensed instance, you can instead use a token from a user assigned only the **Content - Live Preview** and **Forms - Submission** policies.
   - **`NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`**: The public URL of your site. This is used for SEO metadata and blog post routing.
   - **`NUXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_VISUAL_EDITING`**: Visual editing is enabled by default. Set to `false` to disable.

## **Running the Application**

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   _(You can also use `npm install` if you prefer.)_

   **Note for npm users:** This project uses pnpm workspaces. If you're using npm instead, you'll need to:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
   npm install
   ```
   npm doesn't support pnpm's `workspace:` protocol, so you must remove `pnpm-lock.yaml` before running `npm install`. The project will generate a `package-lock.json` instead.

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

3. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Generate Directus Types

This repository includes a [utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/directus-sdk-typegen) to generate TypeScript types
for your Directus schema.

#### Usage

1. Ensure your `.env` file is configured as described above.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pnpm run generate:types
   ```
3. When prompted, enter your Directus admin token (with permissions to read system collections like `directus_fields`), or set it ahead of time via the `DIRECTUS_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable for non-interactive runs (e.g., CI).

> **Note:** The type generation requires an admin token with permissions to read system collections like `directus_fields`. The public token does not have sufficient permissions for this operation. You can either provide the admin token interactively when prompted, or set it via the `DIRECTUS_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable (e.g., `DIRECTUS_ADMIN_TOKEN=your_token pnpm run generate:types`) to run without a TTY. Nuxt also accepts `DIRECTUS_SERVER_TOKEN` for backward compatibility.
